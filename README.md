In this project, I will use a graph to simulate the spread of a pathogen across a population. 
I will explore three different strategies to slow down or stop the spread of the pathogen, leveraging Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes
as well as a few BFS techniques to simulate the process of pandemic transmission.
